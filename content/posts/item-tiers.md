A week later and your character has just reached full gold gear.

Throughout the game's I've played with gear tiers, I'm sure you've noticed a pattern.
Given the choice between a white, blue, and purple wand, most Action RPG players would choose purple.

But there is no definitive categorization. And no definitive genre that these colors are subject to. Whether the game is a Battle Royale, Moba, ARPG, or Roguelike, I'm sure it has gamefaqs threads with frusterated users of unique color tiers.

To better understand how colors are organized to represent rarity of game resources, I will direct your attention to a game called Angband.

## Origins

Rarity color coding for loot has its first appearance in 1997 in the popular game, Diablo. The coloring in Diablo's item tiers is as follows: White for normal items, then blue for magic items, and finally gold for unique items.
In an interview Diablo developer David Brevik attributed the idea for color coded gear to the game Angband, a roguelike where the color of the item's name displayed on screen indicated the type of item it was. Melee weapons were white, books were purple, ranged weapons brown.

But this didn't indicate rarity, and a powerful character may have a fair variety of colors equipped, rather than predominatly one color of item.

Clearly the color choice of items in Angband wasn't following a trend of rarity or power. So the original tiering of these colors to my knowledge is in Diablo.

During the interview, David Brevik didn't give any reasoning regarding any choice of colors, but here is my theory.

## Colors according to Dye rarity in History

Color tierings in videogames tends to go as follows.
White, Grey, and Brown colored items are given low value,
Green, and Blue colored items are given moderate value,
Purple, and Gold colored items are given high value.

And it makes sense intuitively, at least coming from a person who has been raised within a colonial culture.

My most natural, go to mapping for these colors is in Dye rarity, or Dye cost.
When I think of clothes in the past, I imagine undyed white linens as being something that common wealth would dominantly own.
While nobles would own clothes of colored with most expensive purple dyes, with gold being akin to jewlery.

I'm not certain if this musing is true, but I like to entertain that it is.
Because if it is, then I play ZZ-Top's Sharp Dressed Man whenever I roll for need at the end of a dungeon.
