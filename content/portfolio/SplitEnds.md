Split Ends is a trading and exploration focused adventure game with a variety of mod tools including a scripting system and map editor.
It was made using the Unity3D engine with a team of 10 over the course of 4 months.

## My experience
During this project I learned gained a lot of firsthand experience of working with a team that I was unfamiliar with.
Up until this point, every game I had worked on was with people I had already considered close friends. Because of this a lot of our collaboration didn't have any formal structure, and most planning was done verbally.

While of course I did talk to my teammates during development, it was during scheduled video meetings.
